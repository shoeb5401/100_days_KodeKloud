The Nautilus application development team shared static website content that needs to be hosted on the httpd web server using a containerised platform. The team has shared details with the DevOps team, and we need to set up an environment according to those guidelines. Below are the details:

a. On App Server 2 in Stratos DC create a container named httpd using a docker compose file /opt/docker/docker-compose.yml (please use the exact name for file).

b. Use httpd (preferably latest tag) image for container and make sure container is named as httpd; you can use any name for service.

c. Map 80 number port of container with port 8082 of docker host.

d. Map container's /usr/local/apache2/htdocs volume with /opt/devops volume of docker host which is already there. (please do not modify any data within these locations).

version: '3.8'

services:
web:
image: httpd:latest
container_name: httpd
ports: - "8082:80"
volumes: - /opt/devops:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs
