The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up several docker environments for different applications. One of the team members has been assigned a ticket where he has been asked to create some docker networks to be used later. Complete the task based on the following ticket description:

a. Create a docker network named as news on App Server 3 in Stratos DC.

b. Configure it to use bridge drivers.

c. Set it to use subnet 172.168.0.0/24 and iprange 172.168.0.0/24.

docker network create -d bridge --subnet 172.168.0.0/24 --ip-range 172.168.0.0/24 news
