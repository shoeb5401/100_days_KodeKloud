As per recent requirements shared by the Nautilus application development team, they need custom images created for one of their projects. Several of the initial testing requirements are already been shared with DevOps team. Therefore, create a docker file /opt/docker/Dockerfile (please keep D capital of Dockerfile) on App server 1 in Stratos DC and configure to build an image with the following requirements:


a. Use ubuntu:24.04 as the base image.

b. Install apache2 and configure it to work on 6200 port. (do not update any other Apache configuration settings like document root etc).

# Use Ubuntu 24.04 as base image
FROM ubuntu:24.04

# Install Apache2
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y apache2 && \
    apt-get clean

# Change Apache to listen on port 5003
RUN sed -i 's/80/5003/g' /etc/apache2/ports.conf && \
    sed -i 's/:80/:5003/g' /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

# Expose port 5003
EXPOSE 5003

# Start Apache in foreground
CMD ["/usr/sbin/apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
